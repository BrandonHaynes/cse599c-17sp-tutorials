# Spark in the cloud (with Databricks)

## 1. Getting Started
For this tutorial we are going to use Databricks - the commercialization of spark
as a cloud based service from some of the original designers. Using Databricks makes
setup very easy and the free tier is enough to explore Spark functionality.
  1. "Before class" please create a [Databricks Community Edition](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/registration.html#signup/community) account.  [This 3min video](https://databricks.com/product/getting-started-guide) provides a quick overview of Databricks and how to setup up a cluster and notebook.
  2. Databricks makes it easy to create a basic free cluster (6GB of RAM).
     On the left panel click the *Clusters* icon and then the *Create Cluster* button
     and follow the prompts to create a cluster.  In free mode clusters will become
     deactivate after 2h of inactivity.
  3. Upload *spark_tutorial_inclass.ipynb*
    1. On the left panel click the *Workspace* icon to open up Workplace Explore.
    2. Click on the down arrow next to Workspace at the top of the panel.
    3. Click on Import and in the popup dialog drag *spark_tutorial_inclass.ipynb*
  4. Your notbook should open up but is not attached to a cluster.  In the top left
     where it says *Detached* click on the menu dropdown and select the cluster
     you created earlier. (If no cluster is there you can create one from the dropdown)
